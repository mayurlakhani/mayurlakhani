Work experience & internship in companies:
21.06.2021 - 20.12.2021	Livello GmBH, Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia	

Role: IOT Engineer
Project Work: Maintenance and upgrade features on the smart Kiosk.
Smart Fridges consists raspberry pi where the fridge controller, bob agent, network agent, tablet screen, web application and payment terminal run on docker and handles transactions, displays purchase products and automatic payment system. Network Agent switches automatically the connection so if internet connection lost it will auto connect with Wi-Fi, LAN, or LTE vice versa. Bob Agent which handles opening door and closing door status with proximity sensor. Fridge Controller is main heart of the fridge where all the purchase session are handled and Google Cloud Platform IOT Core connected with local MQTT to handle status of the connection and publish or subscribe messages for alert system. Local MQTT connects with cloud MQTT and publishes various message on different topics. Tablet screen handles Web UI where user can enter the pin and unlock the fridge door to purchase or during replenish mode. The provisioning tools is software which will put fridge controller, network agent, bob agent, web application and eclipse - paho MQTT docker at a same time to provision the SD card and install all the software by simply running these project.

 Uni - Research Project	
 
    1.	SOLID(Social Linked Data) (Ref. https://inrupt.com/solid)
    Social linked data a decentralized application to provide true data ownership, no vender lock-in, easy to manage data at one place called pod. It could be connected to any decentralized application systems and can be managed from the anytime anywhere. The application provides web browser as App which will interact with pod and stores the data to the pod. Later it could be also transferred to another app via login using no username password technique but using unique WebID which will authenticate the person who claims as Owner. Its own database server which can be run on any smart device. No need of synchronization but only storage or workspace which will provided by Pod. The motivation comes from now a day’s social media trends and problem of walled garden. User can authorise for read, write or for modification to the specific document or files or even particular directory in decentralization applications.
    2.	Client Relationship Management (J2EE)
    Inspiration from Zoho CRM organization Java web application was made which can handle all the organizational data and customer details, and deals. Oracle database was used to store data and Backend development was done in Java. FrontEnd development was done in Angular and displayed all the stored data to the clients. It deals new clients and their company details and stores into db. Client can see their appointments and details on the calendar and manage it from there. Reminder notifications for special meetings, payments and also for new announcement in the business world.
    3.	IoT (Raspberi Pi4 – Home server)
    Private hosting a website on the Raspberi Pi 4 to analysis and storage of personal data from smart devices.
